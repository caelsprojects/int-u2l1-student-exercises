<p>Im a 17 year old programmer who just graduated high school, I have a big passion for cybersecurity and design. I have a few personal projects that I currently maintain and enjoy working on. I know about 5 progamming languages, all though I am just a beginner in pretty much each one.<br><br> I really enjoy listening to music, playing video game, and working on stuff for my friends! I enjoy playing dungeons and dragons, making minecraft modpacks and servers, and coding projects! I have a willingness to learn and am ready to sponge in all the information I can from Nextech! </p>
